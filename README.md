### Jack of all trades
Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

### Bardic Versatility
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change in focus as you use your skills and magic:
- Replace one of the skills you chose for the Expertise feature with one of your other skill proficiencies that isn't benefiting from Expertise.

## Features
- trance
- darkvision
- proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

## Resources
### Bardic Inspiration *(3d8)*
##### Normal Use
- bonus action, 60ft, 1 creature
- that creature can choose to roll the bardic dice and add to attack roll, saving throw, ability check after seeing the result of their roll but before the DM says it succeed or failed.
##### Psychic Blade
- when hitting with a weapon attack, spend 1 bardic inspiration to add *3d6* psychic damage
### Words of Terror
- 1 per long rest
- If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its mind.
##### Wisdom save vs Spell Save DC *(14)*
